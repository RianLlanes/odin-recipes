    <h1>Onion Rings Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/Onion-Rings.jpg" alt="Onion Rings">
    <p>Onion rings are sliced onions that are dipped in a batter, and deep fried until crisp. These are considered as a fast food favorite; it can also be a good replacement for French fries.
        The secret for a good onion ring is in the batter. The batter must contain the right amount of flavor to compliment the onion. It should also be crisp enough to be enjoyed. While there are many onion ring batter recipes around, I am still sticking with simplest recipe that I know.
        Aside from being simple, I like this recipe because it does not call for any ingredients that are hard to find. The flavor is nice – typical of what I would expect for an onion ring to be – with a terrific texture.</p>
