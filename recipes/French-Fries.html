    <h1>French Fries Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/French-Fries.jpg" alt="French Fries">
    <p>This next potato recipe is number 2 on the list of the potato recipes that I plan to do with the 10 lb of Idaho potatoes that I got a few days ago.
        I like French fries but I prefer them crunchy. I tried making homemade fries from scratch before but it doesn’t give me the crunchiness that I am looking for. There are also other recipes that make use of cornstarch to help make the fries crispy – but I’m all good with the natural potato starch in the potatoes that I’ll be frying.
        Good thing that someone shared to me her secret on how to make crispy French fries a few years back and I’ve been following that style ever since. The technique is called “double frying”; sliced potatoes need to be fried until the texture becomes a little crispy then re-fried until it becomes crispier.
        Try it yourself and let me know what you think.</p>
